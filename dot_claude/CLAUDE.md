# Claude Instructions (Global)

## Dotfiles = chezmoi · source: `~/.local/share/chezmoi/` · public repo NullSense/dotfiles
Files under `~/.config/`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig` are TARGETS. Editing a target without
mirroring to source = silent data loss (next `chezmoi apply`/`update` overwrites it).

- **Never edit a target without mirroring to source in the same response** — either edit the
  source then `chezmoi apply <target>` (preferred), or edit the target then `chezmoi re-add <target>`.
- Path map: `dot_<n>`→`~/.<n>` · `dot_config/<x>`→`~/.config/<x>` · `private_<n>`→0600 ·
  `executable_<n>`→+x · `*.tmpl`→Go-template · `symlink_<n>`→symlink.
- `chezmoi apply` auto-commits AND pushes to the **public** repo — treat applied changes as
  immediately public; never say "local/not pushed". It also bundles unrelated drift.
- Check `chezmoi status` before apply; `MM` = source+target both diverged (blind apply destroys
  target edits). Surface drift you didn't create instead of resolving it. If unsure which side is
  right, ask.
- Never restore files marked `D` (intentionally migrated). Untracked source = unbacked work.
- Commands: `chezmoi status|diff|apply [p]|re-add [p]|edit [p]|cd|git -- <cmd>`.

## Git
Commit finished, verified work without being asked; for chezmoi source, commit + push (autopush
expected). Pause first ONLY if it would bundle unrelated drift, include secrets, rewrite pushed
history, or land on a protected branch with no feature branch.

## Keybindings
Before binding any shortcut (Hyprland/app/shell), grep the config for the exact modifier+key and
confirm it's free; also scan `hyprctl binds` live. If taken, don't clobber — pick a free mnemonic
and tell the user. Hyprland binds: `dot_config/hypr/bindings.conf`.
Taken (non-exhaustive): SUPER+ALT+ C=Capture · D=Dictation · V=Voice menu · R=Recording · G=Grab.

## Testing
Fix a bug → write a regression test immediately (TDD preferred).

## Library docs → Context7 (never web search)
Resolve the ID first, then fetch a narrow topic (1–2k tokens; 5k+ for overviews). Reuse resolved
IDs in-session. Check the version against project deps.

## Structured memory → `~/.claude/memory/`
`general.md` (cross-project conventions) · `tools/*.md` · `domain/*.md`. Write new cross-project
conventions there, not into this file. Keep this file to top-level preferences only.
